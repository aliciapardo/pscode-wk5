// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(4+8)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print("{0} is Even".format(num))
else:
   print("{0} is Odd".format(num)))

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) n= Input “Enter 5 integer value”

b) sum=0.0

For loop with i ranging from 0 - 5

Inside loop sum=n[i]+sum

Outside loop avg= sum/5

Print avg

c) small=n[1] # assume the first number in the list is smallest

large= n[5] # assume the first number in the list is largest

For loop with i ranging from 1 - 5

Inside loop if n[i]<small # if any another number is smaller than small(variable)

Inside if Then small=n[i]

Inside loop if n[i]>large # if any another number is larger than large(variable)

Inside if then large=n[i]

Print small

Print large

d) print avg

print small

print large
